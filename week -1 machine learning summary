sumamry of machine learning 

* Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed.
* Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
* Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

* Python-based: Python is one of the most commonly used languages to build machine learning systems. 


Key Machine Learning terminologies are:

Labels
Features
Models
Training
Inference
Functions
Relationships

Machine learning systems uses Relationships between Inputs to produce Predictions.

In algebra, a relationship is often written as y = ax + b:

y is the label we want to predict
a is the slope of the line
x are the input values
b is the intercept

With ML, a relationship is written as y = b + wx:

y is the label we want to predict
w is the weight (the slope)
x are the features (input values)
b is the intercept

SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

* Supervised machine learning is used to predict defined relationships like "What is spam in an e-mail".
* It is about training algorithms to make predictions, like predicting what kind of video you like, based on the videos you have played.
* Supervised learning is one of the major categories of machine learning algorithms. 
* In this form of learning, the data contains labeled examples of the concept you want the algorithm to learn. 
* For example, if you want an algorithm to predict fraud, you’ll supply it with examples that denote fraud and examples that are non-fraud.
* The algorithm learns to distinguish the two categories. This kind of distinction between categories is called ‘classification’. 
* Another kind of supervised learning is ‘regression’, where an algorithm learns to predict values on a continuous scale, 
* For example, given data for past sales, can we predict future values of sales of a product

           1. LINEAR PREDICTIONS
           
           Linear methods are the simplest, yet often the fastest and most effective set of algorithms. 
           They assume that the data can be represented by a (multidimensional) line.
           In the case of regression, the line represents the structure of the data. 
           In the case of classification, the line represents the boundary between the different classes. 
           
           
           2. NON-LINEAR PREDICTIONS
           
           While linear methods work well enough a lot of the time, real-world problems are sometimes much more complex. 
           
           
 UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
 
 * unsupervised learning does not need labeled data. 
 * The idea behind unsupervised learning is to discover structure in a new data set from scratch. 
 * This can be extremely useful, e.g. finding segments of customers for a consumer product.
 
         1. CLUSTERING
         Clustering is the most common use case for unsupervised learning. 
         The problem of clustering is to find groups within a data set that have some commonalities. 
         Clustering can be used for a variety of applications, from customer segmentation to basic recommendation systems.

Thats it these are the machine learning learnings i learnt from the first unit
